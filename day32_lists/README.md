# Lists

In Computer Science, we learn about a data structure called arrays. Arrays are a place to store more than one thing with the same variable name.

However, Python uses **à§ƒ** instead. Lists are literally lists of items. Any piece of data from any data type can go into a list. We can extract, remove, or change lists.

You may be asking: "What is the point of a list?"

Sometimes, you don't always know how much data you need to store. We can use a loop to move through data in a list without having to first manually tell the computer how many things are in that list.

## Starting at 0
As far as Python is concerned, this is a list. Notice we start counting the first item at 0 (instead of 1).

We can directly add to the list with the variable name, [ ] with the index number of the row.

```py
mtList[2] = "stuff"
```
## Printing Lists

We can directly add to the list with the variable name, [ ] with the index number of the row.

**Let's make a list of our class schedule.**
```py
timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
```
**Let's print our list:**
```py
timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable)
```
 Let's try to print math from our list above:
```py
timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable[1])
```
Remember, we start counting at 0. So the second index, math, is 1.
## Changing Lists

We can also change lists and the index.

We built our list with **timetable =,** but we want to change index 4, **"sport"**. We can do this by calling it with [ ].
```py
timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable[0])
print(timetable[1])
print(timetable[2])
print(timetable[3])
print(timetable[4])
````
**Add this to to the code above:**

```py
timetable[4]= "Watch TV"
```
Why is it not printing correctly? I have created the timetable, printed it out, and changed index 4 of the timetable.

However, I need to print the changed version. Let's print our new index:
```py
timetable[4]= "Watch TV"
print(timetable[0])
print(timetable[1])
print(timetable[2])
print(timetable[3])
print(timetable[4])
```

## Introducing lists' best friend...loops
Why would I want to write all of those lines of code?

We can replace a lot of those lines of code we just wrote with just two lines of code. Change your code to look like this:
```
for new variable in list name:
```

```py
timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Watch TV"]
for lesson in timetable:
  print(lesson)
```

Now we have given the computer a list. We said "make **lesson** each value within this list and then do something with it."

## Common Errors

### Start counting from 0
I used an f-string to print out the first color in my list. Why is it printing the second color in my list, orange, instead of red?
```py
colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Violet"]
print(f"The first color is {colors[1]}")
```
Correct Code
```py
colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Violet"]
print(f"The first color is {colors[0]}")
```
Remember, start counting from 0. The first color in the list, red, is index 0
