### The continue command stops executing code in the loop and starts at the top of the loop again.
### Essentially, we want to kick the user back to the original question.
### Adding continue will start the code from the start and ask the first question again: "Do you go left or right?".
### The else statement refers to any input besides left or right (up or esc). Since the user is a winner, 
### we do not want to use break or it would say they have failed.


while True:
  print ("You are in a corridor, do you go left or right?")
  direction = input("> ")
  if direction == "left":
    print ("You have fallen to your death")
    break
  elif direction == "right":
    continue
  else:
    print ("Ahh! You're a genius, you've won")
    exit()
print ("The game is over, you've failed!")

### exit command directly stop the command


### Commmon Error

### exit is a function after exit you have to put a parenthesis().
